# Lung sound classification system

This repository contains the 1) Bi-ResNet for lung sound classification, which is proposed in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919021). 2) Lung classification system based on a digital stethoscope and an android application, you can find detail information [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918752)

## Bi-ResNet

The architecture of our Bi-ResNet. The input of stft and wavelet are short-time Fourier transform spectrogram and wavelet parameter of one sample![image](http://github.com/mmmmayi/LungSys/pic/architecture.pngï¼‰

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
